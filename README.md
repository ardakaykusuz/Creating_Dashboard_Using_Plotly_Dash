In today’s competitive market, it is essential for businesses to effectively track their performance and understand customer behaviors to make successful decisions. With this in mind, we developed a dynamic dashboard for ABCDEats, focusing on customer segmentation, behavioral analysis, and regional insights. This dashboard aims to provide an intuitive interface for users to visualize and interact with key performance indicators (KPIs), customer patterns, and other important metrics.
In this chapter of our project, I developed a dashboard to analyze customer segmentation and its associated characteristics. While creating the dashboard, it was utilized Plotly Dash to create layouts and interactive charts. The primary goal of creating this dashboard is to provide users with a tool to evaluate ABCDEats’ overall performance and identify patterns among customer clusters. To achieve this, the dashboard is divided the dashboard into several tabs, each designed to focus on a specific analysis aspect, which may allow users to seamlessly navigate KPIs, cluster insights, regional analysis, and cuisine preferences.
